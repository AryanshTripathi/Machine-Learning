- 👋 Hey there, This is Aryansh Tripathi. I'm a student of IIT(BHU) Varanasi.
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence(AI) in particular. But first of all I am honing my logic building and coding skills. In future, I would also like to give Web and Game Development a try. 
- 🌱 I have pretty nice knowledge of C++ and Python. I am currently devoting my time to learn Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA).  
- 💞️ This repository is going to be all about ML and Python. So, anyone who wants to learn, develop and grow together can collaborate. Not very advanced level projects, I'm a novice so decide accordingly.
